The aim of the RforMassSpectrometry initiative is to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software for
the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry
assays, including proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project
formalises the longtime collaborative development efforts of its core
members under the RforMassSpectrometry organisation to facilitate
dissemination and accessibility of their work.
