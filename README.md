# RforMassSpectrometry

The aim of the RforMassSpectrometry initiative is to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software for
the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry
assays, including proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project
formalises the longtime collaborative development efforts of its core
members under the RforMassSpectrometry organisation to facilitate
dissemination and accessibility of their work.

## Software

The RforMassSpectrometry suite of packages are available as git
repositories under the
[RforMassSpectrometry](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry)
organisation. This is the main development and collaboration platform
of the project. Once the packages have reached a satisfactory level of
maturity and stability, they are submitted to the
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) project to integrate with
existing, broader infrastructure for high throughput biology data.

The RforMassSpectrometry initiative aims at co-developing and
maintaining interoperable software to tackle a wide range of needs in
computational mass spectrometry using the R language and
environment. The goal is not to address all possible needs, or those
that we feel we can't offer an improvement for. In the light of these
overall goals, interoperablity is an important one aspect of the
initiative, and we strive to provide a set of software that work
together efficiently, rather that maximising the number of packages.

## Questions

For questions about specific software or their usage, please refer to
the software's github issue page, or use the [Bioconductor support
site](http://support.bioconductor.org/). For questions about the
RforMassSpectrometry initiative, please ... either issues in the web
page repository, or get a dedicated email address?

## Members

Current core members include the developers of the *[MSnbase](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.10/MSnbase)*,
from which this initiative rose.
